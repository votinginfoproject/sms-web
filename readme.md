## Development System Setup
To set your system up to develop this application...

1. Make sure you have everything from the requirements section
2. Run `bundle`

## Docker Development System Setup

It is potentially easier to develop with [Docker][docker].

To compile and run the project, the typical docker `build` and `run`
commands will work. When running, you will need to have the
environment variables above set, because the docker version does not
use the .env file.

With the environment variables set, the commands are:

```
$ docker build -t sms-web .
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 sms-web
```
